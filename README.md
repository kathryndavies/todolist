Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA, Hibernate Rest API

A Restful CRUD API for a simple To-Do list application using Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA and Hibernate.

Requirements:

    Java - 1.8.x
    Maven - 3.x.x
    MySQL - 5.x.x
    Postman 6.x.x

Steps to Setup

1. Clone the application

	git clone https://github.com/kathryndavies/todolist.git

2. Create MySQL database

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE user_data;

3. Change mysql username and password as per your installation

    open src/main/resources/application.properties

    change spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password as per your mysql installation

4. Build and run the app using maven

The app will start running at http://localhost:8080.

The app defines following CRUD APIs:

	GET /api/v1/tasks

	POST /api/v1/tasks

	GET /api/v1/tasks/{id}

	PUT /api/v1/tasks/{d}

	DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{d}
    
    DELETE /api/v1/tasks

These can be tested using Postman or any other rest client. Several Postman tests are provided: Postman/ToDoList.postman_collection.json

(Please note that the {id} values may need to be updated for tests 6, 7 & 8 (PUT, GET and DELETE by id) if any tasks have been added to the database prior to running the Postman tests.)
